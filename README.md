# HR-Analytics-Report

This is the Hr Analytics Report Using PowerBi with these condition rules

Conditional Rules - Applied on the data.
1) To promote employees who have never been promoted in 10 years. 
2) People spending 18+ years in the organization needs to be retrenched.
3) Organization wants to know how many workers are very far ( > 20 miles), near (less than 20 greater than 10), very close.
4) Identify the people who are due for promotion and are going to be retrenched. So, before laying them off we need to give severance benefits to those employees.
5) Make meaning out of the job satisfaction numerical column by creating a conditional column out of it (<=2:High, 3:Medium, 4:Low)
6) Make meaning out of the performance rating column by creating a conditional column out of it (3:High Rating, 4:Low Rating)
